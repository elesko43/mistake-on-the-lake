            <h1 style="color:rgb(77, 73, 73); text-align:center;">Sweet Tooth City</h1>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Cleveland is a city of sweets, you will have a hard time choosing which place to visit first.</p>
               </div>
        
        <h4>Mitchell's Ice Cream</h4>
        <p>Cleveland's big pride and joy is easily Mitchell's Ice Cream. Every batch of ice cream is made in their Ohio City location where you can even watch the process that it takes to make some of your favorite flavors. They have so many options from a classic scoop, specialty sundaes, milkshakes, sodas, and even smoothies, you can never go wrong in a Mitchell's Shop. And, during any given time of the year you will be impressed with their seasonal flavors that will have you drooling.</p>

        <h4>Graeter's Ice Cream</h4>
        <p>Yes, while this spot may have originated in Cleveland's southern neighbor Cincinnati, you still have to stop for a scoop. You can induldge in a classic banana split or stay modest with a single scoop in a sugar cone. Graeter's will leave you wishing you had more.</p>

        <h4>Corbo's Bakery</h4>
        <p>Corbo's in Little Italy has some of the best pastries in the city, and maybe I'm biased, but I used get my birthday cake from here every year. They are famous for their Cassata Cake so be sure to opt for a slice or go crazy and get the 18" cake. It's the perfect place to stop after a pasta dinner in Little Italy.</p>

        <h4>Presti's Bakery</h4>
        <p>Here is where things get contentious. Corbos and Presti's have an age old rivalry in the city, and you're either a fan of one or the other. So take a visit to Presti's for a sweet treat, but make sure that you have also tried Corbo's, too. Then make your final decision and see where you stand on the rivalry.</p>


        
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">In Memoriam: Sweet Moses</h4>
        <p style="text-align: center;">This past October, the city lost one of the most delicious Ice Cream and Soda Shops, Sweet Moses. Their bananas foster ice cream will never be forgotten.</p>
